  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am a quantitative researcher and engineer working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, data science, and financial markets. I earned my Master’s degree in Computer Science from Columbia University in December 2021. Following graduation, I joined The Ohio State University as a Research Associate, where my research focused on data mining and machine learning for medical time-series data, including electronic health records (EHR).
  </p>

  <p>
    My most recent academic work has explored advanced AI-driven frameworks, including the development of collaborative multi-agent systems for medical visual question answering using large language models, as well as systematic investigations into hallucination phenomena in multimodal LLMs. Beyond theory, I have actively translated these AI-agent methodologies into real-world systems, applying them to large-scale decision-making pipelines in both research and industry environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    In industry, I have built and deployed agentic AI systems for complex analytical workflows. At Neuberger Berman, I developed evaluation frameworks and data-retrieval agents for multi-source, agent-based research platforms supporting equity analysis. Previously, as an AI Engineer at CEART, I designed and deployed a large-scale agentic dataroom intelligence platform for renewable-energy finance, automating due diligence across terabytes of deal documentation and reducing evaluation timelines from months to under 24 hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    Motivated by a long-standing fascination with financial markets and quantitative analysis, I began pursuing a Master of Financial Engineering at UC Berkeley in March 2025. My training integrates machine learning with financial modeling and market microstructure, enabling me to apply AI and statistical learning directly to trading and investment research. I have conducted deep learning–based statistical arbitrage research with BlackRock, developing CNN–Transformer models for U.S. rates relative-value strategies, and worked with JPMorgan on LLM-powered pipelines for forecasting equity short interest from large-scale unstructured financial data.
  </p>

  <p>
    With a strong foundation in AI research and quantitative modeling, I focus on building rigorous, data-driven systems that operate in real-world financial environments. I am particularly interested in problems that combine machine learning, market dynamics, and scalable financial infrastructure, and I enjoy collaborating with researchers and practitioners pushing the frontier of quantitative finance.
